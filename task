Hi Maria,
 
Great to chat with you this morning.
 
As discussed, I’ve attached the Excel document that I’ve been working in so far. 


The first sheet in the document called ‘LINKED DATASET’ is the main sheet that consolidates all the data I’ve pulled and displays it by SA2 area i.e. the anchor that links all of the data sets. 


Each subsequent sheet in the document sets out the source material for each column with links to the original source. In some of the tabs I’ve added in some more explanatory notes, including where I was planning to do some more data cleaning or where I’d hit a roadblock.
 
Flagging that we’d also like to include the information in this dataset within the ‘CBDC fees’ sheet: Department of Education Child Care Quarterly Report – Sept 2021, however it’s only presented by SA3 area. I have a separate spreadsheet I’ve been pulling together with the same columns as above (where available), but using SA3 area instead so it can also include this linked data set. The issue with SA3 data is that not all of the other variables we want to look at (e.g. SEIFA) are coded at SA3 level, they only go up to SA2. This is one of the challenges we were hoping to work with you to solve – ideally we wouldn’t need to be working across two different types of SA areas.
 
As mentioned too, I’ll send through the paperwork for you to sign to formalise the working relationship and confirm your pay rate. Flagging that it might come through early Jan rather than in the next couple of days because today is Jacki’s last day at work.
 
Thanks again and hope you have a nice holiday break.
 
Sarah
